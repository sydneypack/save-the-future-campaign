A world of change, a world without pollution, a world free from respiratory and sanitation diseases a world of change, we all need such a world. 

**INTRODUCTION**

I am **Wakabi Sydney**, member of Save The Future Campaign and am glad to introduce my group members with whom i worked during this 
environmental movement and below I unveil.

With great desire and hope to live in a pollution and disease free world, we, humans are coming up with different ways of conserving the environment order to make it a better place. Implementing various ways of fighting water, land and air pollution, humanity comes up with advanced methods of taking action to reduce these kinds of pollution. Pollution does not only affect the environment we live in but also affects our health and lifestyles

**FINDINGS**
We have been so much affected by pollution both environmentally and healthy damages. we ought to fight all these challenges caused by pollution and some of these challenges include;

**ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTHY DAMAGES**

Effects of improper rubbish removal and waste management
Here are 10 negative effects of the improper removal and disposal of waste.
 
1. Soil contamination
Soil contamination is the No. 1 problem caused by improper waste removal and disposal. Some wastes that end up in landfills excrete hazardous chemicals that leak into the soil. Take the case of plastic bottles. When they eventually break down, they release DEHA, a carcinogen that affects our reproduction systems, causes liver dysfunction, and weight loss. Soil contamination does not only affect plant growth, it is also unhealthy to humans and animals feeding on those plants.

It is therefore important that every household takes recycling to heart. Plastics, metals, paper, and electronic wastes can be recycled at your local recycling centres. If everyone takes time to segregate and sort their recyclable wastes and bring them to recycling centres, the bulk of waste that will be removed from the landfills.
2. Air contamination
Waste that contains hazardous chemicals, such as bleach and acids, needs to be disposed of properly, and only in approved containers with correct labels.
Some papers and plastics are burned in landfills, emitting gas and chemicals that hurt the ozone layer. Waste that releases dioxins are also dangerous and pose a health risk when they diffuse into the air that we breathe. Add to that the methane gases that decomposing wastes release.
Finally, landfill gas produced by the decomposing wastes, can be explosive and can harm nearby communities

3. Water contamination
Hazardous wastes in the environment leech into the ground, and ultimately, into ground water. This water is used for many things, from watering the local fields to drinking. Toxic liquid chemicals from waste can also seep into water streams and bodies of water.


Untreated sewage can threaten marine life that comes into contact with the contaminated water. It can destroy and suffocate marine habitats, such as corals. Contaminated water is also dangerous and harmful to humans who consume fish and other marine life.

4. Bad impact on human health
Improper disposal of waste can greatly affect the health of the population living nearby the polluted area or landfills. Waste disposal workers and other employees in these landfill facilities are at a greater risk. Exposure to improperly handled wastes can cause skin irritations, blood infections, respiratory problems, growth problems, and even reproductive issues.
 
5. Impact on animals and marine life
It cannot be stressed enough: our carelessness with our waste and garbage does not just affect us. Animals likewise suffer the effects of pollution caused by improperly disposed wastes and rubbish. Styrofoam and cigarette butts have been known to cause deaths in marine animals who consume them. Animals who consume grasses near contaminated areas or landfills are also at risk of poisoning due to the toxins that seep into the soil.

6. Disease-carrying pests
Mosquitoes and rats are known to live and breed in sewage areas, and both are known to carry life-threatening diseases. Mosquitoes breed in cans and tires that collect water, and can carry diseases such as malaria and dengue. Rats find food and shelter in landfills and sewage, and they can carry diseases such as leptospirosis and salmonellosis. Moreover, moisture production from waste is a breeding ground for mould. It’s bacteria that has the ability to spread and grow given the appropriate conditions, such as moisture production from appliances and food scraps.
7. Adversely affect the local economy
Everyone wants to stay and live in a healthy, clean, fresh, and sanitary place. A city with poor waste management will certainly not attract tourists or investors. Landfill facilities that are mismanaged can cause the local economy to sink, which can then affect the livelihood of the locals.
 
8. Missed recycling opportunities
There is revenue in recycling. Cities that do not implement proper removal and recycling of wastes miss on this. They also miss out on the resources that can be reused and on the employment opportunities that a recycling centre brings.
9. Causes extreme climate changes
Decomposing waste emits gases that rise to the atmosphere and trap heat. Greenhouse gases are one of the major culprits behind the extreme weather changes that the world is experiencing. From extremely strong storms and typhoons to smouldering heat, people are experiencing and suffering the negative effects of greenhouse gases.
10. It is slowly killing the planet
We only have one planet, and our careless handling of waste is harming it. Taking care of the environment is everyone’s responsibility, for ourselves, for our planet, and for our children.

**TOGETHER WE CAN FIGHT THE PROBLEM OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION THROUGH THE FOLLOWING WAYS;**

**Turn off the lights when not in use**

The energy that the lights take also contribute to air pollution, thus less consumption of electricity can save energy. Use energy saving fluorescent lights to help the environment.


3. **Recycle and Reuse**
4.

The concept of recycle and reuse is not just conserve resources and use them judicially but also is helpful for air pollution as it helps in reducing pollution emissions. The recycled products also take less power to make other products.

4. **No to plastic bags**

The use of plastic products could be very harmful to the environment as they take a very long time to decompose, due to their material made up of oil. The use of paper bags instead is a better alternative as they decompose easily and are recyclable.

5. **Reduction of forest fires and smoking**

The collecting of garbage and getting it on fire in dry seasons or dry leaves catching fires is a huge factor for causing air pollution, moreover smoking also causes air pollution and causes the air quality to worsen along with obviously damaging one’s health.

6. **Use of fans instead of Air Conditioner**

The usage of AC’s takes a lot of energy and emits a lot of heat which is bad for the environment. AC’s also take a lot of power and energy to work as compared to fans.

7. **Use filters for chimneys**

The gas that is emitted from fireplaces in homes and factories are extremely dangerous for air pollution and harms the air quality severely. The use of filters should be used at least if the consumption couldn’t be lessened, this will help to reduce the effect of harmful gases absorbing in the air.

8. **Avoid usage of crackers**

The use of crackers during festivals and weddings is sadly one of the biggest contributors to air pollution, leading to a layer of smog which is extremely harmful for health. So, practice of no crackers should be implemented.

9. **Avoid using of products with chemicals**

Products that use the chemicals in their usage or smell strongly, like paints or perfumes should be used less or outside the house. There can also be an alternative to use products with low chemical content and organic properties.

10. **Implement Afforestation**

Last but not the least, plant and grow as many trees as possible. The practice of planting trees provides a lot of benefits to the environment and helps with the release of oxygen.
